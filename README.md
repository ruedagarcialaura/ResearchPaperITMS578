## 2. Project Overview

This research project aims to conduct a qualitative comparative study of the cybersecurity and AI governance frameworks of the European Union (EU) and the United States (US). Our central hypothesis is that the EU’s stricter, unified regulations lead to a more effective response to AI-driven cyber incidents compared to the fragmented US framework.

To test this, we will manually identify, document, and analyze real-world case studies of AI-driven cybersecurity incidents reported in both regions.

**Team Members:**
* Laura Rueda Garcia
* Felipe Susaeta Miguel

## 3. Research Strategy & Methodology

Our methodology is a Qualitative Comparative Analysis based on Manually Compiled Case Studies.

1. **Manual Curation:** Finding and documenting real-world examples of AI-driven cybersecurity incidents.
2. **Case Study Analysis:** For each incident: analyze the attack vector, the corporate and regulatory response, and the overall outcome:
    * **A. Incident Breakdown:**
        * What was the specific attack vector?
        * What AI technology was demonstrably used (e.g., voice cloning, video deepfake, generative AI for phishing)?
        * Who was the target (sector, company size)?
    * **B. Corporate & Public Response:**
        * How and when was the incident detected?
        * What was the immediate financial and operational impact?
        * How did the company publicly disclose the incident (if at all)?
    * **C. Regulatory & Governmental Response:**
        * Was a law enforcement agency involved (FBI, Europol...)?
        * Was a cybersecurity agency involved (CISA, ENISA...)?
        * Were any specific regulations triggered (GDPR data breach notification, state-level laws...)?
        * Were any fines, sanctions, or official recommendations issued as a result?


4. **Comparative Framework:** We will directly compare the nature of the "Regulatory & Governmental Response" (Point 3.C) between the US and EU cases to test our central hypothesis. We will also address the overall scarcity of publicly documented cases as a key finding of our research.

*1. Attempted scam cloning son's voice of Philadelphia attorney:*

- Cybercrime magazine Attoney's son case: https://soundcloud.com/cybercrimemagazine/targeted-complex-ai-phone-scam-almost-lost-thousands-gary-schildhorn-cybercrime-victim : law enforcement: police declined cause he had not lost any money and FBI said they were aware of the scamm but they said there was nothing they couldn't do at the time (because the scammers were changing the money to criptocurrecies right after and they could not follow the trace of the money). Months later because the *Senate sub comedy aging and economic policys* (Key areas of focus include income security, health care (like Medicare), age discrimination in employment, and protection against scams. The committee also submits findings and recommendations to the Senate) approached him to testify. 



- "Unfortunately, existing legislation falls short of protecting victims of this type of scam.": https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/ai-phone-scam-voice-call-b2459449.html . (IP expert Michael Teich wrote in an August column for IPWatchdog that laws designed to protect privacy may apply in some cases of voice-cloning scams, but they’re only actionable by the person whose voice was used, not the victim of the fraud. Meanwhile, existing copyright laws do not recognise ownership of a person’s voice.): *To address the growing number of voice cloning scams, the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) has announced an open call to action. Participants are asked to develop solutions that protect consumers from voice cloning harms, and the winners will receive a prize of $25,000.*

- https://www.perallis.com/blog/bandits-steal-243-000-with-deepfake-audio-mimicking-ceo-voice : Many companies do not advertise they have been scammed, but the info would be helpful to create more regulations: "the German firm is not alone: researchers from the technology company Symantec told the Washington Post that they had found at least three other cases in which the voice of executives was imitated to deceive companies, resulting in losses of millions of dollars."
