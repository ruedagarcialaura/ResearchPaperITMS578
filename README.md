# Policy vs. Practice: A Comparative Analysis of EU and US Responses to AI-Driven Cyber Incidents

## 1. Project Overview

This research project aims to conduct a qualitative comparative study of the cybersecurity and AI governance frameworks of the European Union (EU) and the United States (US). Our central hypothesis is that the EU’s stricter, unified regulations lead to a more effective response to AI-driven cyber incidents compared to the fragmented US framework.

To test this, we will manually identify, document, and analyze real-world case studies of AI-driven cybersecurity incidents reported in both regions.

**Team Members:**
* Laura Rueda García
* Felipe Susaeta Miguel

## 2. Research Strategy & Methodology

Our methodology is a Qualitative Comparative Analysis based on Manually Compiled Case Studies.

1. **Manual Curation:** Each team member is responsible for finding and documenting real-world examples of AI-driven cybersecurity incidents.

2. **Case Study Analysis:** For each confirmed incident, we will analyze the attack vector, the corporate and regulatory response, and the overall outcome:
    * **A. Incident Breakdown:**
        * What was the specific attack vector?
        * What AI technology was demonstrably used (e.g., voice cloning, video deepfake, generative AI for phishing)?
        * Who was the target (sector, company size)?
    * **B. Corporate & Public Response:**
        * How and when was the incident detected?
        * What was the immediate financial and operational impact?
        * How did the company publicly disclose the incident (if at all)?
    * **C. Regulatory & Governmental Response:**
        * Was a law enforcement agency involved (e.g., FBI, Europol)?
        * Was a cybersecurity agency involved (e.g., CISA, ENISA)?
        * Were any specific regulations triggered (e.g., GDPR data breach notification, state-level laws)?
        * Were any fines, sanctions, or official recommendations issued as a result?


4. **Comparative Framework:** We will directly compare the nature of the "Regulatory & Governmental Response" (Point 3.C) between the US and EU cases to test our central hypothesis. We will also address the overall scarcity of publicly documented cases as a key finding of our research.
