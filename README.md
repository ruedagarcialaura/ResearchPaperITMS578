# Comparative Study of International Cybersecurity and AI Policies

## 1. Project Overview

This research project aims to conduct a qualitative comparative study of the cybersecurity and AI governance frameworks of the European Union (EU) and the United States (US). Our central hypothesis is that the EU’s stricter, unified regulations lead to a more effective response to AI-driven cyber incidents compared to the fragmented US framework.

To test this, we will manually identify, curate, and analyze real-world case studies of AI-driven cybersecurity incidents reported in both regions.

**Team Members:**
* Laura Rueda García
* Felipe Susaeta Miguel

## 2. Research Strategy & Methodology

Our methodology is a Qualitative Comparative Analysis based on Manually Curated Case Studies.

1. **Manual Curation:** Each team member is responsible for finding and documenting real-world examples of AI-driven cybersecurity incidents.

2. **Source Vetting:** We will prioritize reports from high-quality, technically focused sources such as major cybersecurity firm blogs (Mandiant, CrowdStrike, Unit 42), government alerts (CISA, ENISA), and reputable tech journalism.

3. **Case Study Analysis:** For each confirmed incident, we will analyze the attack vector, the corporate and regulatory response, and the overall outcome.

4. **Comparative Framework:** We will compare the findings from both regions against key metrics, such as response time, transparency of disclosure, and the application of fines or penalties, to evaluate the effectiveness of each regulatory framework. ESTO NO SÉ
